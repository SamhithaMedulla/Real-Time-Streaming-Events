# 🚀 Data Engineering Meets AI: Real-Time User Analytics Dashboard

A powerful real-time analytics project that captures user interactions across devices, transforms data using the Lakehouse paradigm, and integrates GenAI (Google Gemini Pro) for actionable insights through natural language queries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how modern **data engineering pipelines** can be seamlessly combined with **AI capabilities** to create interactive and insightful dashboards. From ingesting streaming data to transforming and visualizing it — everything is automated, modular, and production-ready.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Apache Kafka** – For ingesting real-time user events  
- **Azure Databricks** – Unified data platform for streaming, storage, and transformations  
- **Delta Lake (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** – For layered data refinement  
- **PySpark** – For scalable data processing  
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** – For modular, version-controlled SQL transformations  
- **Google Gemini Pro (GenAI)** – For asking natural language questions over Gold data  
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards and business KPIs

---

## 🧱 Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - User events (mobile, tablet, desktop) streamed via Apache Kafka.

2. **Lakehouse Layering**  
   - Events written to **Bronze** (raw), transformed into **Silver** (clean), and aggregated into **Gold** (analytics-ready) tables using **Databricks + PySpark**.

3. **Modular SQL with dbt**  
   - Gold-layer data modeled using **dbt** for maintainability and reusability.

4. **GenAI Integration**  
   - Connected **Google Gemini Pro API** to allow natural language queries like:
     - “Which device had the highest engagement?”
     - “Which user was most active?”

5. **Visualization**  
   - KPI dashboards created in **Power BI**, showing:
     - Device usage trends  
     - Session-level user activity  
     - Event heatmaps

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Real-time streaming ingestion  
- ✅ Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline in Delta Lake  
- ✅ Modular dbt models for clean transformations  
- ✅ Natural language Q&A over structured data  
- ✅ Beautiful Power BI dashboard with drilldowns  
- ✅ Scalable, production-ready code architecture

## 🤖 AI-Driven Insights

Using **Google Gemini Pro**, stakeholders can:
- Ask dynamic questions over real-time data
- Skip manual filters/slicing
- Get conversational answers based on the latest events

> “Which device type had the highest click-through rate today?”  
> “Show me the top 5 most active users last hour.”

## ✅ How to Run

1. **Set up Kafka** (or use Databricks Auto Loader for streaming input)  
2. **Run notebooks in Databricks** for Bronze → Silver → Gold  
3. **Use dbt CLI** to run SQL models on the Gold layer  
4. **Call Gemini Pro API** with your prompt  
5. **Connect Power BI** to the final Gold table using SQL/ODBC and visualize KPIs
